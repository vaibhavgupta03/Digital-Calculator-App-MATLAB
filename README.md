# Digital-Calculator-App-MATLAB
This repository contains a simple yet functional digital calculator app designed using MATLAB App Designer. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, providing users with a straightforward interface to perform calculations.

## Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive layout with clearly labeled buttons for easy operation.
Real-Time Results: Get instant results displayed as you perform operations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this application, you'll need:

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- MATLAB App Designer toolbox

### Installation
- Clone the Repository:
- Open the Project:
- Launch MATLAB.
- Navigate to the cloned repository folder.
- Open Calculator.mlapp in MATLAB App Designer.

### Run the Application:
- Click on the "Run" button in the App Designer toolbar.

## How to Design the Calculator
### UI Components:
- Use uipanel for organizing different sections like input numbers, operators, and results.
- Add uitextarea for number inputs and results display.
- Add uibutton for each arithmetic operation.

### Callback Functions:
- Assign each button a callback function to perform the respective arithmetic operation when clicked.
- Ensure the callback functions read the input values, perform the calculation, and update the output field with the result.
  
### Error Handling:
- Implement basic error handling to manage division by zero and invalid inputs.
